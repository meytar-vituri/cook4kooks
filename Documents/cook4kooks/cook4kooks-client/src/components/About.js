            Not everybody like to cook, but everybody's got to eat! <br/>
            During the last period of COVID-19 many of us have faced an unfamiliar situation, we were home, we had plenty of time, we were hungry, we wanted to cook
            but somehow we ended up using wolt or somethig similiar:( <br/>
            The goal of this project is to give everyone the possibillity to cook a dilicious meal step by step with all the instructions needed! <br/>
            Hope you'll enjoy it!
